Unfortunately, PV system downtime and operations and maintenance team inefficiencies lead to lost revenue for all stakeholders. The good news? Solutions have emerged to address C & I solar system performance pain points. Here are five common issues in commercial solar O & M, and how to solve them.', 'Visibility to alerts on potential issues with a PV system isn\\u2019 t the problem. The opposite is more likely true, as the sheer volume of alerts can be overwhelming. This means that trucks get rolled for false alarms or issues that could have been resolved remotely and important alerts aren\\u2019 t noticed quickly enough or are missed altogether.', 'SOLUTION: Smarter monitoring and machine learning technology. The future of solar O & M in C & I has to start with software purpose-built for the task. At Omnidian, we use our proprietary AI-powered technology to monitor assets, cut through the noise of false alerts, and remotely diagnose the root cause of issues.', 'Asset downtime and underperformance drain the return on investment for system owners and drive up OpEx for installers and operators.

In the latest development, Sinopec has lent its financial muscle to the field. The company plans to have the proposed \\u201c Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project \\u201d up and running by 2023, which will add 20,000 tons of annual output to the small but growing supply of sustainable hydrogen in the global economy.', 'In past years, the green hydrogen field has run afoul of the greenwashing matrix. Hydrogen itself is not \\u201c green. \\u201d Hydrogen can serve as a zero emission fuel, whether combusted or used in a fuel cell. However, the primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, and to some extent coal.', 'The \\u201c green \\u201d in green hydrogen has only appeared in recent years, concurrent with the falling cost of wind and solar energy. The availability of low cost renewable energy has made it possible to lower the carbon footprint of electrolyzer systems, which deploy an electrical current to push hydrogen gas out of water.', 'So, now the issue is not so much whether or not green hydrogen is a real thing. The question is to what extent the interest in green hydrogen will pump up the overall demand for hydrogen too quickly, enabling the supply of fossil sourced hydrogen in the global economy to go up instead of down.', 'That brings us to Sinopec, aka China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, the well-known Bejing-based energy firm. Though best known for its fossil energy interests, Sinopec has been dabbling in biofuels and it looks like sustainable hydrogen is next in line.', 'Sinopec has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to transition out of fossil-sourced hydrogen. The company currently states its hydrogen output at a total of 3.5 million tons annually. Meanwhile, its newly launched \\u201c Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project \\u201d will only produce 20,000 tons annually.', 'That gap could grow instead of shrinking, if Sinopec follows through on a $ 4.6 billion pivot into natural gas and hydrogen. Also, according to the China Hydrogen Energy Alliance, the annual demand for hydrogen in China alone could grow into the range of 60 million tons annually by 2050.', 'Still, at 20,000 tons the new hydrogen project is nothing to sneeze at. It will be among the biggest such facilities in the world when it commences operations in June 2023, if not the biggest.', 'Actually, it could be the very biggest, by far. The firm Air Liquide has a large-scale electrolyzer facility up and running in Canada, but the output barely scrapes 3,300 tons annually ( 8.2 tonnes daily). Shell has an electrolyzer project under way in Germany that will produce 1,300 tons of hydrogen annually. If you know of any other big projects in the works, drop us a note in the comment thread.', 'If Sinopec calls it quits after a single 20,000-ton project, that would be the end of the story. However, the company has put out signals that the new facility is intended to provide a model for others to follow.', 'One signal is the scale of the company\\u2019 s commitment to the sustainable hydrogen infrastructure.', '\\u201c As part of the project, Sinopec will build a new photovoltaic power station with an installed capacity of 300MW and annual power generation of 618 million kilowatt-hours, an electrolyzed water hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons, a spherical hydrogen storage tank with hydrogen storage capacity of 210,000 standard cubic meters, and hydrogen transmission pipelines with a capacity of 28,000 standard cubic meters per hour ( including supporting power transmission and transformation facilities), \\u201d the company explains.', 'Another hint is the existence of a buyer. According to Sinopec, its Tahe Refining & Chemical division will use green hydrogen from the new facility to decarbonize its hydrogen production.', 'That brings up an interesting point about green hydrogen, which is that refinery operations account for a leading source of demand for hydrogen. So, all things being equal, green hydrogen would be deployed to enable the continued production of petroleum-based fuels and chemicals.', 'Well, that\\u2019 s the way the cookie crumbles. If the Tahe deal comes through, it would follow a broader trend of deploying renewable energy to in tandem with fossil sources. Sinopec, for example, is among the energy firms that use solar panels to power their oil fields.

Unfortunately, PV system downtime and operations and maintenance team inefficiencies lead to lost revenue for all stakeholders. The good news? Solutions have emerged to address C & I solar system performance pain points. Here are five common issues in commercial solar O & M, and how to solve them.', 'Visibility to alerts on potential issues with a PV system isn\\u2019 t the problem. The opposite is more likely true, as the sheer volume of alerts can be overwhelming. This means that trucks get rolled for false alarms or issues that could have been resolved remotely and important alerts aren\\u2019 t noticed quickly enough or are missed altogether.', 'SOLUTION: Smarter monitoring and machine learning technology. The future of solar O & M in C & I has to start with software purpose-built for the task. At Omnidian, we use our proprietary AI-powered technology to monitor assets, cut through the noise of false alerts, and remotely diagnose the root cause of issues.', 'Asset downtime and underperformance drain the return on investment for system owners and drive up OpEx for installers and operators.

ptype technology to ntype technology the importance of selecting the right module for a given project is even more crucial yet the way the industry operates even among the biggest buyers is through a bilateral conversation with one manufacturer at a time mike hall ceo at anza a data and technology procurement marketplace for solar and energy storage in the us compares it to how people used to buy airline tickets in the s and the need to call each airline separately to check prices and availability of tickets right now the market operates in an inefficient way that doesn t make use of modern technology the market is opaque or not transparent to the buyers and the sellers says hall many clients we talked to are deciding what cell technology to buy do they buy monoperc technology it s still kind of the industry standard but is starting to get overtaken by topcon cell technology and in most cases you re going to pay more for a module that has topcon cells but the question is how much more should you pay the shift between monoperc the leader for many years towards tunnel oxide passivated contact topcon began in especially in the second half of the year as shown by jinkosolar s shipments up to the third quarter of with ntype modules accounting for nearly of total shipments hall adds that it is the same case with anza s clients which predominantly bought monoperc modules at the beginning of while topcon took the lead by the end of the year there are only just starting to be viable heterojunction hjt options in the us market with real deliveries mostly towards the back half of so we haven t seen a big conversion explains hall as the technology available shifts from ptype to ntype which one to choose and whether it is worth paying more for newer technologies is dependent on the specifics of a project the more you re getting paid per megawatt hour the more you should be willing to pay for a more efficient technology that will produce more megawatt hours says hall this is the case for community solar projects in the us explains hall where the value of hjt technology over topcon can be really significant as projects can get paid us kwh or more of course a better way to evaluate which module to select for a given project would be to look at the entire lifetime of the system rather than its price says hall adding we think the industry should be shopping and making decisions not based on costs but on effective dollar per watt because that s the best proxy for total value it does take into account the lifetime energy production by aggregating all the data from several manufacturers it would allow developers independent power producers and other module buyers to better compare the current market available to them without aggregating all that data and without having the technology to do the analytics most companies are at best looking at three four or five potential providers comprehensively what we see is at any given time there can be pretty significant spreads in the market if you re not surveying the whole market you re missing out on some value opportunity this gives buyers three advantages to make more optimal financial decisions better assess risk and save time right now all of the risk items are opaque be it counterparty risk or product risk in the us we have a lot of trade risk and a lot of trade issues all of that is opaque the only way you can extract it is through a whole lot of calls and emails to the manufacturers and back and forth earlier this week the company launched a new procurement evaluation platform which among other things included external supply factors such as the us antidumping and forced labour trade laws but also performance in extreme weather conditions or price changes\",\n          \"cisolar the th solar

In the latest development, Sinopec has lent its financial muscle to the field. The company plans to have the proposed \\u201c Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project \\u201d up and running by 2023, which will add 20,000 tons of annual output to the small but growing supply of sustainable hydrogen in the global economy.', 'In past years, the green hydrogen field has run afoul of the greenwashing matrix. Hydrogen itself is not \\u201c green. \\u201d Hydrogen can serve as a zero emission fuel, whether combusted or used in a fuel cell. However, the primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, and to some extent coal.', 'The \\u201c green \\u201d in green hydrogen has only appeared in recent years, concurrent with the falling cost of wind and solar energy. The availability of low cost renewable energy has made it possible to lower the carbon footprint of electrolyzer systems, which deploy an electrical current to push hydrogen gas out of water.', 'So, now the issue is not so much whether or not green hydrogen is a real thing. The question is to what extent the interest in green hydrogen will pump up the overall demand for hydrogen too quickly, enabling the supply of fossil sourced hydrogen in the global economy to go up instead of down.', 'That brings us to Sinopec, aka China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, the well-known Bejing-based energy firm. Though best known for its fossil energy interests, Sinopec has been dabbling in biofuels and it looks like sustainable hydrogen is next in line.', 'Sinopec has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to transition out of fossil-sourced hydrogen. The company currently states its hydrogen output at a total of 3.5 million tons annually. Meanwhile, its newly launched \\u201c Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project \\u201d will only produce 20,000 tons annually.', 'That gap could grow instead of shrinking, if Sinopec follows through on a $ 4.6 billion pivot into natural gas and hydrogen. Also, according to the China Hydrogen Energy Alliance, the annual demand for hydrogen in China alone could grow into the range of 60 million tons annually by 2050.', 'Still, at 20,000 tons the new hydrogen project is nothing to sneeze at. It will be among the biggest such facilities in the world when it commences operations in June 2023, if not the biggest.', 'Actually, it could be the very biggest, by far. The firm Air Liquide has a large-scale electrolyzer facility up and running in Canada, but the output barely scrapes 3,300 tons annually ( 8.2 tonnes daily). Shell has an electrolyzer project under way in Germany that will produce 1,300 tons of hydrogen annually. If you know of any other big projects in the works, drop us a note in the comment thread.', 'If Sinopec calls it quits after a single 20,000-ton project, that would be the end of the story. However, the company has put out signals that the new facility is intended to provide a model for others to follow.', 'One signal is the scale of the company\\u2019 s commitment to the sustainable hydrogen infrastructure.', '\\u201c As part of the project, Sinopec will build a new photovoltaic power station with an installed capacity of 300MW and annual power generation of 618 million kilowatt-hours, an electrolyzed water hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons, a spherical hydrogen storage tank with hydrogen storage capacity of 210,000 standard cubic meters, and hydrogen transmission pipelines with a capacity of 28,000 standard cubic meters per hour ( including supporting power transmission and transformation facilities), \\u201d the company explains.', 'Another hint is the existence of a buyer. According to Sinopec, its Tahe Refining & Chemical division will use green hydrogen from the new facility to decarbonize its hydrogen production.', 'That brings up an interesting point about green hydrogen, which is that refinery operations account for a leading source of demand for hydrogen. So, all things being equal, green hydrogen would be deployed to enable the continued production of petroleum-based fuels and chemicals.', 'Well, that\\u2019 s the way the cookie crumbles. If the Tahe deal comes through, it would follow a broader trend of deploying renewable energy to in tandem with fossil sources. Sinopec, for example, is among the energy firms that use solar panels to power their oil fields. Coal mines and other extractive sites are also increasingly turning to renewables.', 'Sinopec also recently signed an agreement with Jinko Solar to build solar canopies at 18 Sinopec filling stations in China. That is just one of Sinopec\\u2019 s growing suite of solarization projects, and therein lies another hint about the company\\u2019 s green hydrogen intentions.', 'Last week Jinko put out the word that it has inked a major solar power deal with Sinopec Star, which plans to build \\u201c several industrial-scale solar-powered, emission-free, hydrogen production facilities across China. \\u201d', 'The facilities will \\u201c serve as proof of concept for the cost-competitive production of hydrogen from advanced solar technology, \\u201d Jinko added.', 'Earlier in December, Sinopec President Ma Yongsheng also seemed to mark a sharp pivot in Sinopec\\u2019 s plans for growth in the hydrogen economy.', 'In recent years, Sinopec and China have been targeting conventional, fossil-sourced hydrogen as a \\u201c clean \\u201d fuel but, during a conference in Bejing, Ma Yongsheng indicated a shift in emphasis for Sinopec, towards so-called \\u201c blue \\u201d hydrogen as well as green hydrogen.', 'In terms of keeping fossilized carbon sequestered underground where it belongs, \\u201c blue \\u201d hydrogen is a public relations gimmick. It refers to producing hydrogen from fossil sources, in combination with a carbon capture system.', 'The green hydrogen track has more potential to make a planet-saving impact, partly because legacy engineering firms are beginning to fall all over themselves in pursuit of new business in the green hydrogen field.', 'Mitsubishi, for example, has introduced a new gas turbine designed to transition into green hydrogen as supplies become available, and Cummins is scaling up its hydrogen electrolyzer technology with a $ 5 million assist from the US Department of Energy. Not to be outdone, GE has embarked on a pilot project that could eventually convert the 1,100 megawatt Cricket Valley gas power plant in upstate New York to run on green hydrogen.', 'The green hydrogen supply chain is also maturing. One good example is Siemens Gamesa, which has hooked up with the thermoplastics firm Strohm to supply piping for a green hydrogen mashup with offshore wind farms.', 'Photo: Sustainable hydrogen site prepping for construction ( courtesy of Sinopec).', 'Tina specializes in military and corporate sustainability, advanced technology, emerging materials, biofuels, and water and wastewater issues.

hydrogen field and yet leading players on the global energy stage seem willing to give it a whirl in the latest development sinopec has lent its financial muscle to the field the company plans to have the proposed sinopec xinjiang kuqa green hydrogen pilot project up and running by which will add tons of annual output to the small but growing supply of sustainable hydrogen in the global economy in past years the green hydrogen field has run afoul of the greenwashing matrix hydrogen itself is not green hydrogen can serve as a zero emission fuel whether combusted or used in a fuel cell however the primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas and to some extent coal the green in green hydrogen has only appeared in recent years concurrent with the falling cost of wind and solar energy the availability of low cost renewable energy has made it possible to lower the carbon footprint of electrolyzer systems which deploy an electrical current to push hydrogen gas out of water so now the issue is not so much whether or not green hydrogen is a real thing the question is to what extent the interest in green hydrogen will pump up the overall demand for hydrogen too quickly enabling the supply of fossil sourced hydrogen in the global economy to go up instead of down that brings us to sinopec aka china petroleum chemical corporation the wellknown bejingbased energy firm though best known for its fossil energy interests sinopec has been dabbling in biofuels and it looks like sustainable hydrogen is next in line sinopec has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to transition out of fossilsourced hydrogen the company currently states its hydrogen output at a total of million tons annually meanwhile its newly launched sinopec xinjiang kuqa green hydrogen pilot project will only produce tons annually that gap could grow instead of shrinking if sinopec follows through on a billion pivot into natural gas and hydrogen also according to the china hydrogen energy alliance the annual demand for hydrogen in china alone could grow into the range of million tons annually by still at tons the new hydrogen project is nothing to sneeze at it will be among the biggest such facilities in the world when it commences operations in june if not the biggest actually it could be the very biggest by far the firm air liquide has a largescale electrolyzer facility up and running in canada but the output barely scrapes tons annually tonnes daily shell has an electrolyzer project under way in germany that will produce tons of hydrogen annually if you know of any other big projects in the works drop us a note in the comment thread if sinopec calls it quits after a single ton project that would be the end of the story however the company has put out signals that the new facility is intended to provide a model for others to follow one signal is the scale of the company s commitment to the sustainable hydrogen infrastructure as part of the project sinopec will build a new photovoltaic power station with an installed capacity of mw and annual power generation of million kilowatthours an electrolyzed water hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of tons a spherical hydrogen storage tank with hydrogen storage capacity of standard cubic meters and hydrogen transmission pipelines with a capacity of standard cubic meters per hour including supporting power transmission and transformation facilities the company explains another hint is the existence of a buyer according to sinopec its tahe refining chemical division will use green hydrogen from the new facility to decarbonize its hydrogen production that brings up an interesting point about green hydrogen which is that refinery operations account for a leading source of demand for hydrogen so all things being equal green hydrogen would be deployed to enable the continued production of petroleumbased fuels and chemicals well that s the way the cookie crumbles if the tahe deal comes through it would follow a broader trend of deploying renewable energy to in tandem with fossil sources sinopec for example is among the energy firms that use solar panels to power their oil fields coal mines and other extractive sites are also increasingly turning to renewables sinopec also recently signed an agreement with jinko solar to build solar canopies at sinopec filling stations in china that is just one of sinopec s growing suite of solarization projects and therein lies another hint about the company s green hydrogen intentions last week jinko put out the word that it has inked a major solar power deal with sinopec star which plans to build several industrialscale solarpowered emissionfree hydrogen production facilities across china the facilities will serve as proof of concept for the costcompetitive production of hydrogen from advanced solar technology jinko added earlier in december sinopec president ma yongsheng also seemed to mark a sharp pivot in sinopec s plans for growth in the hydrogen economy in recent years sinopec and china have been targeting conventional fossilsourced hydrogen as a clean fuel but during a conference in bejing ma yongsheng indicated a shift in emphasis for sinopec towards socalled blue hydrogen as well as green hydrogen in terms of keeping fossilized carbon sequestered underground where it belongs blue hydrogen is a public relations gimmick it refers to producing hydrogen from fossil sources in combination with a carbon capture system the green hydrogen track has more potential to make a planetsaving impact partly because legacy engineering firms are beginning to fall all over themselves in pursuit of new business in the green hydrogen field mitsubishi for example has introduced a new gas turbine designed to transition into green hydrogen as supplies become available and cummins is scaling up its hydrogen electrolyzer technology with a million assist from the us department of energy not to be outdone ge has embarked on a pilot project that could eventually convert the megawatt cricket valley gas power plant in upstate new york to run on green hydrogen the green hydrogen supply chain is also maturing one good example is siemens gamesa which has hooked up with the thermoplastics firm strohm to supply piping for a green hydrogen mashup with offshore wind farms photo sustainable hydrogen site prepping for

transmission planners with the eastern interconnection a major power grid serving twothirds of the united states and canada recently gave a favorable review in their assessment of how well regional plans mesh to maintain systemwide reliability however the planners known as the eastern interconnection planning collaborative eipc added a cautionary note eipc s zach smith executive committee chairman said planners concluded that the eastern interconnection remains strong and that individual and collective transmission planning activities have yielded a system that is reliable and wellcoordinated on both a regional and interconnectionwide basis smith issued a word of warning though nevertheless looking forward the grid is being challenged in new ways as the profile of the generation fleet and customer demands are rapidly changing he said continued vigilance and effective use of planning tools and coordination with policymakers are essential for ensuring that today s strong and reliable grid remains so in the future the eipc state of the grid report stated that regional transmission plans including generator retirements and additions require continued study and interconnectionwide coordination to prevent various regional plans within the grid from conflicting eipc member pjm interconnection recently noted that it has been working closely with electric generators within its region to gauge their fuel supply situation this winter iso new england another segment of the eastern interconnection has cited high liquefied natural gas prices and pipeline constraints as challenges its member utilities will grapple with this winter the eipc report outlines planning evaluations and initiatives undertaken to test the bulk power system s resiliency eipc said the coalition noted the collaboration has yielded case analyses a production costing simulation database frequency response analysis electricgas coordination modeling coordination and various activities to support state and federal policymakers and agencies eipc comprises major transmission planning coordinators that plan and operate the bulk power grid throughout the eastern interconnection the report serves as an informational tool for policy makers and regulators said smith it provides objective information from those directly charged with the responsibility to plan a reliable transmission grid in the eastern interconnection smith added it addresses the present and future state of transmission planning for bulk power grid reliability and the interregional

Solutions have emerged to address C & I solar system performance pain points. Here are five common issues in commercial solar O & M, and how to solve them.', 'Visibility to alerts on potential issues with a PV system isn\\u2019 t the problem. The opposite is more likely true, as the sheer volume of alerts can be overwhelming. This means that trucks get rolled for false alarms or issues that could have been resolved remotely and important alerts aren\\u2019 t noticed quickly enough or are missed altogether.', 'SOLUTION: Smarter monitoring and machine learning technology. The future of solar O & M in C & I has to start with software purpose-built for the task. At Omnidian, we use our proprietary AI-powered technology to monitor assets, cut through the noise of false alerts, and remotely diagnose the root cause of issues.', 'Asset downtime and underperformance drain the return on investment for system owners and drive up OpEx for installers and operators.

ptype technology to ntype technology the importance of selecting the right module for a given project is even more crucial yet the way the industry operates even among the biggest buyers is through a bilateral conversation with one manufacturer at a time mike hall ceo at anza a data and technology procurement marketplace for solar and energy storage in the us compares it to how people used to buy airline tickets in the s and the need to call each airline separately to check prices and availability of tickets right now the market operates in an inefficient way that doesn t make use of modern technology the market is opaque or not transparent to the buyers and the sellers says hall many clients we talked to are deciding what cell technology to buy do they buy monoperc technology it s still kind of the industry standard but is starting to get overtaken by topcon cell technology and in most cases you re going to pay more for a module that has topcon cells but the question is how much more should you pay the shift between monoperc the leader for many years towards tunnel oxide passivated contact topcon began in especially in the second half of the year as shown by jinkosolar s shipments up to the third quarter of with ntype modules accounting for nearly of total shipments hall adds that it is the same case with anza s clients which predominantly bought monoperc modules at the beginning of while topcon took the lead by the end of the year there are only just starting to be viable heterojunction hjt options in the us market with real deliveries mostly towards the back half of so we haven t seen a big conversion explains hall as the technology available shifts from ptype to ntype which one to choose and whether it is worth paying more for newer technologies is dependent on the specifics of a project the more you re getting paid per megawatt hour the more you should be willing to pay for a more efficient technology that will produce more megawatt hours says hall this is the case for community solar projects in the us explains hall where the value of hjt technology over topcon can be really significant as projects can get paid us kwh or more of course a better way to evaluate which module to select for a given project would be to look at the entire lifetime of the system rather than its price says hall adding we think the industry should be shopping and making decisions not based on costs but on effective dollar per watt because that s the best proxy for total value it does take into account the lifetime energy production by aggregating all the data from several manufacturers it would allow developers independent power producers and other module buyers to better compare the current market available to them without aggregating all that data and without having the technology to do the analytics most companies are at best looking at three four or five potential providers comprehensively what we see is at any given time there can be pretty significant spreads in the market if you re not surveying the whole market you re missing out on some value opportunity this gives buyers three advantages to make more optimal financial decisions better assess risk and save time right now all of the risk items are opaque be it counterparty risk or product risk in the us we have a lot of trade risk and a lot of trade issues all of that is opaque the only way you can extract it is through a whole lot of calls and emails to the manufacturers and back and forth earlier this week the company launched a new procurement evaluation platform which among other things included external supply factors such as the us antidumping and forced labour trade laws but also performance in extreme weather conditions or price changes\",\n          \"cisolar the th solar
